# Final Project: Getting and Cleaning Data Course

In this repository, you will find two files: the codebook and run_analysis.R.

## run_analysis.R

run_analysis.R is the desired R script that produces the tidy data desired by this project.
This is broken up and completed in five steps:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

In run_analysis.R, there are comments that specify which code corresponds to which part.

The end result is data that is tidy and easy to read.
